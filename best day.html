            This is the main area. Bitcoin whales are people with very large
            amount of BTC, some of these guys were the early investors of BTC
            while others are the world's big billionaires. Spoofing is a game,
            just as a game is full of fun, winners and losers, so is spoofing
            (pump and dump). In this case the winners are usually the whales
            while the losers are the crypto newbies. When a whale wants to
            spoof, he either withdraw a large amount of coins causing FUD (Fear,
            Uncertainty and Doubt), the market will react with traders selling
            off their coins too. When the whale discovered that the price of the
            coin is cheaper as a result of the FUD he created, he will then buy
            back the coin at a cheaper rate. After buying back, the market will
            surely jack up (because a whale just bought some coins), this will
            create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) the market will again react by
            buying more coins with the feeling that another bull run has begun.
            When the whale discovered that the price is now very high, he can
            decide to sell again. The circle continues. Whales don't do
            technical analysis, they don't do fundamental analysis, they don't
            follow signals, they are the market; they play game (spoof).

            Just thinking of how to style this. I am just learning css. Bitcoin
